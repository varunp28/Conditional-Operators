# Conditional-Operators\AIM:
Learning how to use Conditional Statements in C++.

OBJECTIVE:
Understand different types of conditional statements in C++.

Learn how to make decisions in a C++ program using if, if-else, else-if, and switch statements.

Implement logic-based branching to control program flow.

TOOLS REQUIRED:
C++ Compiler (GCC, Turbo C++, etc.)

IDE or Text Editor (Code::Blocks, VS Code, etc.)

THEORY:
Conditional statements allow a program to execute certain parts of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They are essential for decision-making in any program.

Types of Conditional Statements in C++:
if statement:
Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

if-else statement:
Executes one block of code if the condition is true, another block if it is false.

else-if ladder:
Used when there are multiple conditions to test.

switch statement:
Useful when comparing a single variable to multiple constant values.
